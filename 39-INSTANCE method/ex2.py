# Define Instance Method
# Instance variables are not shared between objects. Instead, every object has its copy of the instance attribute.
# Using the instance method, we can access or modify the calling objectâ€™s attributes.
#
# Instance methods are defined inside a class, and it is pretty similar to defining a regular function.


# Use the def keyword to define an instance method in Python.
# Use self as the first parameter in the instance method when defining it. The self parameter refers to the current object.
# Using the self parameter to access or modify the current object attributes.
# You may use a variable named differently for self, but it is discouraged since self is the recommended convention in Python.
