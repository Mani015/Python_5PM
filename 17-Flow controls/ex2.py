
# In Python, elif is short for "else if" and is used when the first if statement isn't true,
# but you want to check for another condition.
# Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks.
# A full if/elif/else block is in the code example below

a_cool=False
b_hot=True

if a_cool:
    print('please wear moneky caps')
elif b_hot:
    print('Thumps up taste the thunder')
else:
    print('It is normal climate ')
