# Break Statement:
# The break statement is used inside the loop to exit out of the loop.
# It is useful when we want to terminate the loop as soon as the condition is fulfilled instead of doing the remaining iterations.
# It reduces execution time.
# Whenever the controller encountered a break statement, it comes out of that loop immediately

# import keyword
# a=keyword.kwlist
# print(a)
# print(len(a))
